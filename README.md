# GENOS SLACK BOT
Welcome to the Genos bot for Slack! The goal of this bot is to be a fun collaborative bot that anyone can work 
on/add things if they want. The hope is that this bot will continue to evolve throughout everyone's time at MSU and
maybe even later! The name Genos comes from the show One Punch Man, where Genos is a cyborg who's constantly 
getting upgrades and new features. This bot is also meant to be fun! That's another reason Genos was chosen as the name,
since One Punch Man is an incredibly funny show.
